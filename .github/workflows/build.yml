# GitHub Actions Workflow for Xiaomi Pad 6 Kernel Build

This document outlines a proposed GitHub Actions workflow to build the Linux kernel for the Xiaomi Pad 6 (sm8250) from the `pipa-mainline/linux` repository, targeting postmarketOS. The workflow will handle environment setup, kernel compilation, and packaging.

## 1. Workflow Overview

The workflow will consist of the following main steps:

*   **Checkout Code**: Clone the `pipa-mainline/linux` repository.
*   **Setup Build Environment**: Install necessary dependencies and cross-compilers for ARM64 architecture.
*   **Configure Kernel**: Apply the `sm8250.config` as the base configuration.
*   **Build Kernel**: Compile the kernel using `make`.
*   **Package Kernel**: Use `pmbootstrap` to package the compiled kernel into a format suitable for postmarketOS.
*   **Upload Artifacts**: Store the resulting kernel package as a GitHub Actions artifact.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before running this workflow, ensure the following:

*   A GitHub repository (can be a fork of `pipa-mainline/linux` or a new repository where you push the kernel source).
*   Basic understanding of GitHub Actions syntax.

## 3. Proposed `main.yml` Workflow File

Create a file named `main.yml` (or any other descriptive name) inside the `.github/workflows/` directory of your repository. The content of the file will be as follows:

```yaml
name: Build Xiaomi Pad 6 Kernel

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches:
      - vipaoL/dev # Trigger on pushes to the vipaoL/dev branch

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0 # Fetch all history for proper git operations

    - name: Install build dependencies
      run: |
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libncurses-dev bison flex libssl-dev libelf-dev bc ccache rsync git-lfs
        # Install cross-compiler for ARM64
        sudo apt-get install -y gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu g++-aarch64-linux-gnu

    - name: Setup pmbootstrap (for packaging)
      run: |
        sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip
        pip3 install --user pmbootstrap
        # Add pmbootstrap to PATH for current session
        echo "$HOME/.local/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH
        pmbootstrap init --force --no-interact --apkbuild-path=$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/pmaports # Initialize pmbootstrap
        # Assuming pmaports will be created or cloned separately if needed

    - name: Prepare kernel source
      run: |
        # Copy the sm8250.config to .config
        cp arch/arm64/configs/sm8250.config .config
        # Ensure the .config is valid for the current kernel version
        make olddefconfig

    - name: Build kernel
      run: |
        # Set cross-compilation variables
        export ARCH=arm64
        export CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-
        # Build the kernel
        make -j$(nproc)

    - name: Package kernel with pmbootstrap
      run: |
        # This step assumes you have a device package for Xiaomi Pad 6 in pmaports
        # If not, you might need to create one or adjust this step.
        # For simplicity, we'll assume a generic packaging for now.
        # You might need to adapt this based on actual pmOS device packaging.
        pmbootstrap build --envkernel linux-xiaomi-pad-6 # Example package name

    - name: Upload kernel artifacts
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: xiaomi-pad-6-kernel
        path: ~/.local/var/pmbootstrap/packages/linux-xiaomi-pad-6-*.apk # Adjust path as per pmbootstrap output
```

## 4. Explanation of Steps

*   **`workflow_dispatch`**: Allows you to manually trigger the workflow from the GitHub Actions tab.
*   **`push` on `vipaoL/dev`**: The workflow will automatically run whenever changes are pushed to the `vipaoL/dev` branch.
*   **`runs-on: ubuntu-latest`**: Specifies that the job will run on the latest Ubuntu Linux runner provided by GitHub.
*   **`actions/checkout@v3`**: An action that checks out your repository code, making it available to the workflow.
*   **`Install build dependencies`**: Installs essential tools and the `aarch64` cross-compiler necessary for building an ARM64 kernel.
*   **`Setup pmbootstrap`**: Installs `pmbootstrap` and initializes it. Note that `pmbootstrap` typically works with a `pmaports` tree. For a custom kernel build, you might need to adjust how `pmbootstrap` is used or integrate it with an existing `pmaports` setup for Xiaomi Pad 6.
*   **`Prepare kernel source`**: Copies the `sm8250.config` to `.config` and runs `make olddefconfig` to update the configuration based on the kernel source, filling in any new options with their default values.
*   **`Build kernel`**: Sets the `ARCH` and `CROSS_COMPILE` environment variables and then runs `make -j$(nproc)` to compile the kernel, utilizing all available CPU cores.
*   **`Package kernel with pmbootstrap`**: This is a placeholder step. The exact `pmbootstrap` command will depend on how the Xiaomi Pad 6 is integrated into the postmarketOS `pmaports` system. You might need to create a specific `APKBUILD` for your device's kernel if one doesn't exist.
*   **`actions/upload-artifact@v3`**: Uploads the compiled kernel package as an artifact, which you can then download from the GitHub Actions run page.

## 5. Next Steps

1.  **Create the workflow file**: Copy the YAML content above into `.github/workflows/main.yml` in your GitHub repository.
2.  **Adjust `pmbootstrap` packaging**: You may need to investigate how postmarketOS packages kernels for specific devices (e.g., by looking at existing `pmaports` for similar devices) and adapt the `Package kernel with pmbootstrap` step accordingly.
3.  **Trigger the workflow**: Push the changes to your `vipaoL/dev` branch or manually trigger the `workflow_dispatch` event from the GitHub Actions tab.
4.  **Monitor the build**: Check the GitHub Actions run logs for any errors or successful completion.
5.  **Download artifacts**: Once the build is successful, download the generated kernel package.

This workflow provides a starting point. Depending on the specifics of the `pipa-mainline` kernel and the postmarketOS requirements for Xiaomi Pad 6, further adjustments might be necessary, especially in the `pmbootstrap` packaging step.
